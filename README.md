Vaccine butler is a script designed to run ontop of NYC's Vaccine Finder website to automate appointment booking. It is intended to be used by non-technical users, and help anyone who is frustrated with being unable to find any open appointments. 

## How To Use

1) Goto Vaccine finder and complete the form until the page where it shows available appointments
2) Open dev tools and paste the code snippet into chrome console, or using the Snippets panel
3) Fill in the modal to specify your booking parameters
4) Leave the tab open (and active!) and wait for your appointment to book
5) When your appointment is ready you'll hear an audio cue and can come back to your computer to finalize the details.

## User Support

We will be adding a chat to help people with running the script after launch.
